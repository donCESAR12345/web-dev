        <p>
          In this tutorial you will presented to some of the most used
          networking commands in Linux, these commands are useful to know if a
          host is up and receiving requests, or to scan a network and find
          pingable hosts, trace the rout of a ping packet over a network.
          As you may know, Linux is well known for being a versatile tool in the
          computing area, and of course, this includes networking them. Base
          Linux distributions include at least the first command of this list,
          if you want to be a system administrator or network engineer (among
          many other careers) you must know at least the existence of the
          commands, because you can always check the manual (<code>man</code>).
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3> ip or ifconfig </h3>
        <p>
          The <code> ip </code> command is the newer version of the
          well known <code> ifconfig </code> command, which is
          <a href="https://dougvitale.wordpress.com/2011/12/21/deprecated-linux-networking-commands-and-their-replacements/"> deprecated </a>
          on most Linux machines, it is used to show and/or manipulate routing,
          network devices, interfaces and tunnels, as always, you can use
          <code> ip -h </code> to show a not so detailed help on the command
          usage, or if you really want to read and understand the command, use
          the <code> man </code> command giving "ping" as the argument.
        </p>

        <h3> netstat or ss </h3>
        <p>
          The <code> ss </code> command is the newer version of the
          <code> netstat </code> command, which is deprecated as well, its
          purpose is to display sockets statistics (as it name implies),
          revealing what applications are communicating to the internet or even
          between them locally in your computer. Most of the options are
          filters, to tell the command which kind of sockets you want to list or
          how you want to see them in the case you will parse them later.
        </p>

        <h3> curl </h3>
        <p>
          The <code> curl </code> command is a really powerful tool to send
          petitions to servers, including several protocols like HTTP, HTTPS,
          SSH, FTP and SMB. Commonly used to download files from servers.
        </p>

        <h3> nmap </h3>
        <p>
          The <code> nmap </code> command is a complicated mess, so I'll just
          cite its manual:
          <blockquote>
            Nmap is an open source tool for network
            exploration. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks. Nmap uses
            raw IP packets to determine what hosts are available on the network,
            what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering,
            what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type
            of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
            characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many
            systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks
            such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and
            monitoring host or service uptime.
          </blockquote>

        <h3> Summary </h3>
        <p>
          In this video a really nice guy from Linode presents to you an amazing
          video teaching you the networking commands which I already covered
          before.

      <table class="ml-table">
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>Efficiency without ML</th>
          <th>Efficiency using ML</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>67.45%</td>
          <td>89.43%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>43.32%</td>
          <td>56.95%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>89.98%</td>
          <td>94.32%</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        That's why ML is doing an excellent job here, I recommend trying it by
        your own, you will be amazed with the results.
